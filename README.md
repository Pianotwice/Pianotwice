- 👋 Hi, I’m Fernando Javier Bermúdez Salazar, but you can call me @Pianotwice
- 👀 I’m naturally creative and I dream of creating high-quality games with unforgettable stories. I want to use my programming skills to help build a better world for everyone. I also want to help businesses innovate and grow. As an accountant and administrator, I have a strong understanding of business and I'm excited to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python, JavaScript, and Java with the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. I'm pursuing a postgraduate degree in Python and Data Science at the Universidad Autónoma de Chile. I'm always eager to learn new things, like exploring other programming languages. I also have a knack for learning new languages and immersing myself in different cultures.
- 💞️ I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with innovative and creative industries. I'm looking for projects that envision the future and have the potential to make a lasting impact. I would love to be part of a team that creates video games that are as memorable as classic books. My dream is to contribute to games that are so groundbreaking that they will still be played in the 22nd century. I'm also interested in developing applications that can help people live better lives
- 📫 How to reach me ... just search Pianotwice in google or just write me down an inbox here, I'm going to be glad to answer.
